This is a repository of my portfolio including projects where I used Python tools like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodel to analyze product trends and extract insights in maximizing profit.  I also show case projects where I used SQL to extract insight like determining factors &amp; causes that contribute to power losses.
